I found a good simple ripple program (Respect!) written by processing in OpenProcessing Web.  
Then I converted the processing program into openFrameworks.  
This is the light version of my previous program [rippleTest](https://github.com/superpeachman/rippleTest).  
Quality of processed image is 50% down but the execution speed up to 200%.
